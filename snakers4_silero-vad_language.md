### Model Description

Silero VAD: pre-trained enterprise-grade Voice Activity Detector (VAD), Number Detector and Language Classifier (95 languages). Enterprise-grade Speech Products made refreshingly simple (see our STT models). **Each model is published separately**.

Currently, there are hardly any high quality / modern / free / public voice activity detectors except for WebRTC Voice Activity Detector (link). WebRTC though starts to show its age and it suffers from many false positives.

**(!!!) Important Notice (!!!)** - the models are intended to run on CPU only and were optimized for performance on 1 CPU thread. Note that the model is quantized.

### Additional Examples and Benchmarks

For additional examples and other model formats please visit this [link](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) and please refer to the extensive examples in the Colab format (including the streaming examples).

### References

Language classifier model architecture is based on similar STT architectures.
